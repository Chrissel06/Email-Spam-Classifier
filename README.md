# Email-Spam-Classifier
This project involves building a machine learning model that can classify emails as either "Spam" or "Not Spam" based on the content of the email. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled emails and leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to transform text data into meaningful features.
